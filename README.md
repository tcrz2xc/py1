# 📁 My Project Portfolio
## Hey there! Welcome to my central project hub.

What is this?
This repo is a curated collection of my work. It's where I keep track of everything I'm building and everything I've built, from small scripts to full-scale applications.

How often is it updated?
I don't update this daily. Instead, I follow a monthly update cycle to bundle significant progress and new project additions, keeping everything here fresh and current.

Feel free to explore!
