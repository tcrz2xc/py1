# Router & Network — Spectrum Notes and Recommendations

## Spectrum router behavior
Many Spectrum routers intercept DNS and force ISP resolvers.
If you cannot enable bridge mode, use per-device DNS or add your own router behind Spectrum.

## Recommended actions
- Use per-device DNS for AdGuard
- Consider adding a dedicated router behind Spectrum for full control
- Use Tailscale for remote access without changing router
